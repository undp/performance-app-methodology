## Introduction&#x20;

This indicator takes information from the ERC (Evaluation Resource Center) to measure the performance in managing evaluation, including the timely conduct of evaluations, the completion and implementation of management responses, and the quality of decentralised evaluations.&#x20;

This is a Country Office level indicator.&#x20;

## Organisational Objective

The organisational objective can be broken down into three parts:

1. 100% of the planned evaluation was completed on time.
2. 100% of completed evaluations have management responses with no overdue key actions.&#x20;
3. 100% of evaluations are of acceptable quality.&#x20;

## Calculation of Scoring

The Evaluation Management Indicator is&#x20;

### **Part 1: Evaluation Planning (30% weight)**

&#x20;Completed, planned, overdue o Scoring based on % evaluations overdue, based on the plan (points deduction for overview) o Show planned evaluations on project and CPD management page

### **Part 2: Evaluation Management Responses (30% weight)**

#### A) % Evaluations without a management response 6+ weeks after evaluation (50% of Part 2)

This measure quantifies the share of evaluations missing a management response six weeks after their conclusion. It serves as an indicator of how effectively and promptly management addresses the outcomes of evaluations.

Score = 1 - (Number of Evaluations Overdue by > 6 Weeks/Total Completed Evaluations in Programme Period )

#### B) Key actions overdue (50% of Part 2)

Within Section 2B, each of the following makes up 50%:

* Non-Overdue Key Actions / Total Actions = % Not Overdue Actions
* Not Long-Overdue Key Action / Total Actions = % Not Long Overdue Action



## **Part 3: Evaluation Quality (40% Weight)**&#x20;

This section determines the overall quality of evaluations based on a comprehensive scoring system. Evaluation quality is critical, reflecting the depth, accuracy, and usefulness of the evaluations conducted.

Six distinct scores are possible, each reflecting a specific level of evaluation quality. These scores are predetermined and assigned based on established criteria that evaluate various aspects of the evaluation process and its outcomes.

| Quality Level             | Scores |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| High Satisfactory         | 100    |
| Satisfactory              | 90     |
| Moderately Satisfactory   | 80     |
| Moderately Unsatisfactory | 70     |
| Unsatisfactory            | 60     |
| Highly Unsatisfactory     | 50     |

The final quality score is derived by calculating the assigned scores' straight average across all programme period evaluations. This average score provides a clear, quantitative measure of the overall quality of evaluations.
