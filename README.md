# Introduction

A consistent and clear methodology has been adopted to enable transparent tracking and communication of performance across the wide range of indicators in the app. This methodology will evolve based on feedback from across the organisation as the underlying indicators and data change.&#x20;

All changes to this methodology are [version-controlled on GitHub.](https://github.com/undp/performance-app-methodology)

If you have questions, comments, or feedback on this methodology, please contact **Jessica Murray \<jessica.murray@undp.org>** and **Emanuele Faja \<emanuele.faja@undp.org>**

## **Traffic Light System & Normalizing to 100**&#x20;

A traffic light system is used to classify indicator performance into clear categories:

* Green: Corporate Target achieved
* Yellow: Progress made, but target not yet achieved
* Red: Limited to no progress against target, requires management attention

The thresholds for these categories are tailored to each indicator based on the nature of the metric and data. This provides an intuitive visual cue on the status of each indicator.

In addition, all indicators are converted into normalised scores on a scale of 0 to 100. This puts indicators with differing units and targets on the same standardised scale, allowing aggregation and comparisons.

This normalised score is specific to that indicator and allows it to be plotted on a consistent scale of 0-100. The overall index score is calculated by averaging the normalised scores across the individual indicators

The advantages of this standardised methodology include:

* Enables quick visual comprehension of status through colour coding
* Normalises varied indicators for aggregation, analysis, and layering.&#x20;
* Provides an intuitive index for overall performance tracking
* Allows performance comparisons across units and categories
* Simplifies communicating progress to diverse audiences

## Avoiding the Aggregation Trap&#x20;

A common pitfall when aggregating performance data from country and regional units to the global level is masking underperformance within averages. This "aggregation trap" occurs when strong performance in some units compensates for weak performance in others, resulting in an overly optimistic global average. Everything looks green, and senior leadership needs to figure out where to focus attention.&#x20;

To avoid this, the performance app methodology takes the following approaches:

* Global indicator scores are calculated as true global averages across all countries rather than averages of regional aggregates. This surfaces variations in country-level results.
* Indicator drill-down functionality allows disaggregated analysis of country and regional data. Users can identify areas of weak performance despite strong overall averages.
* Minimum thresholds for the traffic light categories (e.g. red below a certain number) ensures units with significant underperformance cannot be hidden by compensating high scores elsewhere.
* Trend data is analysed at the country and regional level for insights on changing performance patterns.
* Qualitative assessments supplement quantitative data to explain contextual performance factors.

By using actual global averages, preserving disaggregation, applying absolute threshold levels, incorporating trends and adding qualitative insights, the Performance App methodology aims to avoid obscuring performance variations across locations and units. This provides a more accurate picture to inform management and enable targeted improvements.

The UNDP Global score is calculated by a simple average of the scores of the five key areas. There is no set reporting period â€” all scores are automatically updated as the underlining data sets are updated in the UNDP Data Warehouse.
