# Operating Unit Mapping

{% hint style="info" %}
These files require updating.
{% endhint %}

The two files below help to map OUs (Operating Units), such as Country Offices and other offices, to countries and Bureaus. This ensures that the Performance App uses the correct terminologies for each Operating Unit.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/country_lookup.xlsx" %}
Provide ISO standards for countries
{% endfile %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/Office to Country Mapper.csv" %}
