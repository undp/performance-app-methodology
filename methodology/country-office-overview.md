# Country Office Overview

The Country Office Overview page shows key details at a glance. It is an excellent resource for leaders to understand the status of a UNDP Country Office quickly.

## Leadership Details

These details are taken from two Sharepoint lists that are maintained by OHR (Office of Human Resources):
