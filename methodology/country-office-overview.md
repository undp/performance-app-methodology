# Country Office Overview

The Country Office Overview page shows key details at a glance. It is an excellent resource for leaders to understand the status of a UNDP Country Office quickly.

## Leadership Details

These details are taken from two Sharepoint lists that are maintained by OHR (Office of Human Resources):

### Outcome Overview

### Unlinked Projects

Some projects are supposed to be linked based on the project type, but they are not linked for some reason. This can be due to the data structure that we cannot programmatically link them to CPD Outcomes.&#x20;

### Programme by Funding Partner Type

* We should have this, we will need to investigate.&#x20;
* From IATI\_Financials
* Do a sum for the CPD period&#x20;
* Disagreeagte by FUND\_CODE

### Major Implementing Partners

* List all the projects
* Sum all the budgets
* Disagreegate by Implementing Partner Type

## Pipeline Analytics

### Pipeline Stat Cards

This is taking information directly from Unity, the official UNDP CRM.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pipeline Stages Explained**

UNDP&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* **Total Number of Opportunities —** This counts the number of active opportunities from Unity across all the different pipelines.&#x20;
* **Total Pipeline Value —** This is the sum of the value of all opportunities across all the different pipeline stages. {Are we applying the discounts for this?}
* Average Opportunity Value — Again, is this discounted or not?
* **Close Rate —** This is the percentage of opportunities that lead to signed agreements in the previous calendar year.&#x20;
* **Total Number of Opportunities (Pipeline A) —** Total number of Unity opportunities in Pipeline A for the country office.&#x20;
* Total Pipeline A Value — Is this discounted or not discounted?&#x20;
* **Total Number of Opportunities (Pipeline B) —** Total number of Unity opportunities in Pipeline B for the country office.&#x20;
* Total Pipeline B Value — is this discounted or not discounted?&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This should be discounted pipeline values and change the names of the cards to "discounted" to make it clear so we dont get any question about it.&#x20;
