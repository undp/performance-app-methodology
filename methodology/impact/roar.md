## Introduction

The Results-Oriented Annual Report (ROAR) is the principal instrument for reporting on the performance and progress of results achieved across UNDP's interventions and programmes by operational units. This annual reporting exercise provides a comprehensive assessment of key results achieved by UNDP at the country, regional, and global levels.

The ROAR allows UNDP to capture measurable progress, analyze it, draw lessons, and make decisions to improve performance as a development partner. Country Offices monitor their programs against the Strategic Results Framework (SRF) and compile the ROAR annually, which UNDP Headquarters aggregates at the organizational level.

The ROAR is intended to provide a basis for feedback and continuous adjustment of UNDP's work. It complements other reporting mechanisms like the Country Programme Document (CPD) and Integrated Results and Resources Framework (IRRF) monitoring. In the ROAR, Country Offices are asked to provide objective, qualitative and quantitative evidence to verify any stated changes or results, drawing from external sources such as national statistics, evaluations, and partner reports.

In summary, the ROAR is UNDP's annual corporate performance reporting tool that captures results achieved across its global portfolio, enabling analysis, learning, and course correction for improved development effectiveness. It is a key component of UNDP's results-based management approach.
