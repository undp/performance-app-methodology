## Introduction to the Indicator

Institutional Resources compares revenue vs. expenditure, similar to how a profit-and-loss statement in the private sector works. This informs the organisation if it's running at a surplus or a deficit for any given time.&#x20;

## Organisational Objective

The organisational objective is not to run at a deficit and have a balanced budget.

## Calculation of Scoring

### 1. Revenue (50 out of 100 points)

1. Steady or increasing is 100 points.&#x20;
   1. For mid-year calculations â†’ Do the same trendline as other efficiency&#x20;
2. Add a filter: Adjust revenue for inflation and set baseline as the 5th year going back&#x20;
3. Create a five-year average.&#x20;
4. Decreasing from the five-year average is points off.
5. For each 1% off the average, we knock off 1 point

### 2. Balanced Budget (50 out of 100 points)



1. If the revenue vs expenditures are balanced, or there is a surplus, full points.&#x20;
   1. This is updated on a monthly basis
   2. Payroll
   3. GMS
   4. [UNDP-at-a-Glance](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/bfae426e-1f64-46cf-893e-ffcb697221a1/ReportSectionc7c5b80b86ba42599069?experience=power-bi\&bookmarkGuid=Bookmark7f5b9235a6274cdc75b7)
   5. Against average monthly cumulative surplus/deficit of the last five-year trendline.&#x20;
