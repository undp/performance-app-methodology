## Introduction

The UNDP Environmental Management Tool (EMT) methodology follows international standards like the GHG (GreenHoues Gas) Protocol to measure UNDP's carbon footprint across facilities, vehicles, and travel. The assessment scope includes emissions from activities paid for and controlled by UNDP like office utilities, vehicle fuels, staff travel, etc. It excludes project activities by external entities.UNDP facilities data covers main offices, and other offices are extrapolated based on the number of personnel. Shared offices are prorated based on UNDP's share.

The main categories of emissions are:

* Air travel&#x20;
* Electricity&#x20;
* Vehicle fuel use&#x20;
* Refrigerants&#x20;
* Heating&#x20;
* Public transport&#x20;

## Organisational Objective

The Greening Moonshot aims to reduce UNDPâ€™s total carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 2018. This requires reducing the three main categories of Facility Electricity, Vehicle Fuels, and Air Travel by 55%.

## Calculation of Scoring

To track annual progress towards the 2030 target, a linear reduction trendline will be plotted from the 2018 baseline to the 2030 goal of 50% reduction.

Each year, the maximum allowed carbon footprint level will be identified based on this linear reduction trendline. If the total carbon footprint is below this trendline-based maximum level in any given year, then the full score of 100 points will be awarded.

However, for every 1% that the actual annual total carbon emissions exceeds the maximum level allotted for that year as per the linear reduction trendline, 2 points will be deducted from the total possible score of 100.

We can provide an example for 2022:

* To stay within the trendline for the 2030 target, the 2022 target was a maximum of 52,184 tCO2e.&#x20;
* The actual 2022 carbon footprint was 52,535 tCO2e&#x20;
* So the actual emissions were 52,535 - 52,184 = 351 tCO2e higher than the trendline maximum
* 351 tCO2e is 0.67% higher than the trendline maximum (351/52,184 = 0.0067 i.e. 0.67%)
* As per the methodology, for every 1% above the maximum, 2 points are deducted
* Therefore, the score would be:
  * 100 points (max)
  * 0.67% above the maximum
  * 0.67 rounded up is 1%
  * 2 points deducted for being 1% above the maximum
  * So the total score is 100 - 2 = 98 points

The traffic light indicator methodology for this indicator is:

* Green = 100+
* Yellow = 90+
* Red = <90
