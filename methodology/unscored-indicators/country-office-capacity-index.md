# Country Office Capacity Index

Identifying Country Offices struggling with capacity challenges can help leaders to prioritize which offices need more support. This is especially true for low capacity offices implementing high risk projects and portfolios. The CO Capacity Index was created for the Performance App as part of the initiative to define high risk projects for the organization. It is a composite of performance in 5 indicators across the App: % achievement of IRRF targets, delivery, last CO audit rating, Integrated Financial Dashboard (IFD) rating, and vacancy rate. Each CO is classified as either low, medium-low, medium-high, or high capacity based on their performance in these 5 indicators. This index will be tested as part of the pilot roll-out of the Performance App and will be adjusted over time depending on the needs of the organization.

The scores for Capacity Index is based on the following metric

* OAI Rating
* IFD Rating
* Delivery Rate
* Vacancy Rate
* IRRF

Each metric is scored up to a total of 20 points, which are averaged together to give a final score of 20, which is the official Country Office Capacity Index score.&#x20;

OAI Rating is as follows:

* Fully Satisfactory = 20
* Satisfactory / Some Improvements Needed = 15
* Partially Satisfactory / Major Improvements Needed = 10
* Unsatisfactory = 0

IFD Rating is as follows:

* Acclaim = 20
* Satisfactory = 17
* Concern = 8
* Critical = 0

Delivery:

\


* Met or Exceeded target = 20
* Above 95% of target = 15
* Above 85% of target = 10
* Below 85% of target  = 5

\


Vacancy Rate is expressed as a % of total staff:

* Below 15% vacancy rate = 20
* Between 15% to 20% vacancy rate = 17
* Between 20% to 30% vacancy rate = 12
* Above 30% vacancy rate = 8

IRRF:

* Met or exceeded = 20
* Above 95% = 17
* Between 85% to 95% = 12
* Below 85% = 8

Total calculations:

* High (Capacity) = 16+
* Medium-High = 13 to <16
* Medium-Low = 11 to <13
* Low = <11

Normalized to 100
