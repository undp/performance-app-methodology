## Introduction

ICPE stands for Independent Country Programme Evaluation. This is the five-year evaluation of a country office’s results. It looks at five categories:

1. Relevance
2. Coherence
3. Efficiency
4. Effectiveness
5. Sustainability

## Calculation of Scoring

To calculate the Independent Country Programme Evaluation (ICPE) scores, a two-step process is followed:

Firstly, an average score is calculated for each of the five criteria—Relevance, Coherence, Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Sustainability. This is done by assessing the performance of the UNDP country office in each criterion and determining an average based on these evaluations.

Secondly, once the average scores for each criterion are obtained, these are then combined to compute the overall average score. This is achieved by taking the average of the five individual criterion scores. This overall average provides a comprehensive assessment of the country office's performance across all critical aspects of the evaluation.

* An average score of 4 corresponds to 100%.
* An average score of 3 corresponds to 80%.
* An average score of 2 corresponds to 60%.
* An average score of 1 corresponds to 40%.

| Traffic Light | Score |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Green         | 80+   |
| Yellow        | 60+   |
| Red           | <60   |

## **Limitations & Future Improvements**

ICPE has only been undertaken in a limited amount of Country Offices, making this indicator limited in use for global performance monitoring.&#x20;
