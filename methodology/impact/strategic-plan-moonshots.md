## Introduction

The Strategic Plan Moonshots are a set of highly ambitious goals established in UNDP's [ 2022—2025 Strategic Plan.](https://strategicplan.undp.org/) The Strategic Plan was developed using a futures-oriented approach to design for the complexity and uncertainty of our rapidly changing world.

As part of the Plan's development, UNDP leadership decided to set some "moonshot" goals to convey UNDP's strategic choices and scale up its ambition to reach the SDGs despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. These moonshots represent stretch targets but are considered achievable, not impossible.

There are four Moonshots:

1. **100 million people** to escape multidimensional poverty
2. Access to clean energy for **500 million people**
3. **800 million people** to participate in elections
4. **$1 trillion of public expenditure** and private capital invested in the SDGs.

## Organisational Objective

\
The organisational objective is to achieve the four Moonshots, which requires staying on track throughout the strategic plan's four years.

## Calculation of Scoring.

The scoring for the Strategic Plan Moonshots indicator is calculated as follows:

1. Each of the four Strategic Moonshots contributes equally to the overall indicator score, with a maximum of 25 points per moonshot.
2. If a Strategic Moonshot meets or exceeds its milestone, it receives the full 25 points.
3. For Strategic Moonshots that have not fully met their milestones, the points are awarded proportionally based on the percentage of the milestone achieved. This is calculated by multiplying the achievement percentage by 25 points. For example, if a Strategic Moonshot has reached 70% of its milestone, the points awarded would be: 70% × 25 points = 17.5 points
4. In cases where the milestone is defined as a range, the average of the range is used to calculate the achievement percentage.
5. The points from each Strategic Moonshot are then summed to give the overall indicator a total score out of 100.
