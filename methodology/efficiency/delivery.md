## Introduction

Delivery is the disbursement of funds towards project/programme activities. More specifically, the sum of POs (Purchase Orders) and disbursements related to programmes for the current period.&#x20;

The Delivery Indicator within the Performance App focuses on monitoring and evaluating the achievement of UNDP's delivery targets. This indicator is crucial for understanding how effectively UNDP meets its operational and project-related goals over time and for donor reporting.

It is also important to understand that delivery must be tracked both for Regular (i.e. Core) and Other (i.e. non-core funding such as donor funding) Resources. This is because UNDP must effectively delivery using Regular Resources to be able to make a case for raising the amount of Core Fudning from member states.

## Organisational Objective

To meet the delivery targets each year and to grow overall delivery year-on-year at an inflation-adjusted level.

## Calculation of Scoring

The scoring system for the Delivery indicator at UNDP is a dynamic and sophisticated method designed to provide a detailed understanding of performance against set targets, considering historical achievements and current efforts.

The process begins with a trend analysis, where the average percentage of targets reached each month over the past five years is calculated. This historical data establishes a trendline as a benchmark for assessing current performance. The construction of this trendline is important, as it incorporates seasonal variations and long-term trends, thus setting a realistic standard for current and future performance evaluation.

Following the establishment of this trendline, the current point in time performance is compared against it. This comparison is crucial as it offers immediate insights into how the current efforts align with historical standards. It measures the consistency and effectiveness of the current strategies when viewed in the context of past performance. In simple terms, this asks the question: _Are we above or below where we usually are at this point of the year in delivery?_

The final step in the scoring process involves applying a scoring metric:

* If the current month's performance meets or exceeds the trendline, a full score of 100% is given. This means the performance is on par with or better than the historical average.
* If the performance falls below the trendline, a penalty is applied. For every 1% drop below the trendline, 3 points are deducted from the score out of 100. For example, if the performance is 3% below the trendline, 9 points are deducted, resulting in a score of 91%.

This scoring method emphasizes the importance of meeting or surpassing past performance and encourages consistency or improvement and highlights the importance of meeting or exceeding past performance and motivates us to strive for consistency and improvement.

## Traffic Light System

| Traffic Light | Score |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Green         | 85+   |
| Yellow        | 70+   |
| Red           | <70   |



## Limitations and Future Improvements

- Ideally, there should be an exponential penalty for each month. Being 10% behind the average trend of the last five years in January is not a significant issue compared to being 10% behind in December when most of the year's delivery has already happened.
- We do not account for inflation when discussing year-on-year delivery changes. This is important as over five years the purchasing power of a single dollar can vary significantly. This can lead to situations where we have, on paper, the highest delivery in a decade, while teams on the ground reports being stretched for resources because their spending power is actually much lower than is apparent.
