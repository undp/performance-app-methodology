## Introduction

The UNDP Integrated Results and Resources Framework (IRRF) sets out the development results, indicators and targets that UNDP aims to contribute to from 2022-2025 in alignment with the[ new Strategic Plan. ](https://strategicplan.undp.org/) In other words, the IRRF measures our results as an organisation.&#x20;

Grounded in a rigorous consultative process, the IRRF spans three tiers cascading from development impact to institutional outcomes, outputs and organisational effectiveness.&#x20;

1. Tier 1 (Impact) — This tier captures long-term development changes in people's lives and the planet that UNDP contributes to. It is monitored through global indicators like poverty, inequality, and gender norms.
2. Tier 2&#x20;
   1. Outcomes — Medium-term institutional and behavioural changes in 3 areas that UNDP contributes to through work with partners. Monitored through SDGs and global indicators.
   2. Outputs — Short-term results from UNDP projects and activities across 6 signature solutions and 3 enablers. Direct UNDP accountability through 21 output indicators.

The Performance App only measures the performance of Tier 2b because these are the indicators that speak directly to UNDP’s contribution and achievement of development results. \


Tier 2b includes 22 Results (i.e. Outputs) across UNDP's signature solutions and enablers, directly reflecting UNDP's work. Assessing results against IRRF targets provides a crucial means for UNDP to account for its contributions toward [Agenda 2030.](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals)

The output indicators span UNDP's 6 signature solutions:&#x20;

1. Poverty and Inequality (4 indicators)
2. Governance (4 indicators)
3. Resilience (4 indicators)
4. Environment (2 indicators)
5. Energy (2 indicators)
6. Gender Equality (3 indicators).

There are also 3 Enablers, with 1 output each:

1. Digital Capabilities — People and institutions equipped with strengthened digital capabilities and opportunities to contribute to and benefit from inclusive digital societies (1 indicator)
2. Innovation — Innovation capabilities built, and approaches adopted to expand policy options at global, regional, national and sub-national levels&#x20;
3. Financing for the SDGs — Public and private financing for the achievement of the SDGs expanded at global, regional, and national levels

Within all of these outputs, 57 indicators measure results from a specific baseline.&#x20;

The indicators reflect a range of development areas that UNDP supports, such as policy and institutional strengthening, service delivery, climate resilience, women's empowerment, governance, crisis prevention and recovery, natural resource management, clean energy access, digital skills, and sustainable financing.

Each indicator measures direct UNDP contribution through tracking metrics such as the number of countries supported, the number of people benefiting from services, the number of policies strengthened, the number of solutions adopted, and the amount of financing mobilised. Any specific Country Office may contribute to a subset of these indicators, based on their programmes and focus areas.&#x20;

## Organisational Objective

The organisational objective is that all milestones at every country office are met, and through this, we have the achievement of the global level milestones&#x20;



## Calculation of Scoring

* 100% Cap and why
* We no longer have a 75% cap where we count scores below as zero.&#x20;
* Result → Output Name
* Irrf\_statement → Is the indicator
* Component\_statement → Sub-category of the indicator (i.e. male or female)
* Data is collected at the component level, but we will measure at aggregator at the indicator level, so we do not overweight indicators with many sub-categories.&#x20;
* So we are calculating the average % achievement of IRRF milestones, globally.  \~69%
* How many milestones have reached 100%. This is 61%.&#x20;
* Counts
  * The "cleaned" sheet in the spreadsheet contains a total of 5,948 rows.
  * After filtering out rows with zero values in the specified columns, there are 4,679 rows remaining in the "cleaned" sheet.​
