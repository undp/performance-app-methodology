## Introduction

In simple terms, turnover refers to the rate at which employees leave a company and are replaced by new ones over a specific period. It can be viewed from 
two angles - internal and external turnover. 

1. **Internal Turnover:**  when employees leaving their current positions or departments for other roles within UNDP. This 
type of turnover can be positive when it promotes career growth and job satisfaction by offering opportunities for personal 
development and skill enhancement However, excessive internal turnover might indicate deeper issues like lack of advancement 
options or ineffective communication channels among employees and management, requiring attention to ensure employee retention.

2. **External Turnover:**, involves individuals leaving UNDP entirely to pursue opportunities elsewhere. While this type of turnover can result from a range of factors – such as better compensation packages offered by competing companies or dissatisfaction with organizational policies and culture – it serves as a vital metric for assessing overall employee engagement, satisfaction, and the effectiveness of the company's retention strategies.

The Performance App, and the OHR dashboards on which it is based, measures only the second type of turnover. [Ensure that this is correct]

While it is natural for any organization to experience some degree of turnover, there is an optimal level that balances employee retention and fresh perspectives.  The recommended benchmark standard for effective performance is set at 15%, which signifies that UNDP should maintain annual turnover within this range, allowing room for healthy fluctuations while ensuring stability and continuity of operations. 

Because of the programmatic nature of UNDP's work, a higher turnover than global average is expected as staff and consultants join and leave the organization as programmes start and finish. 

The goal of managing turnover, therefore, is not to minimize it to zero but rather maintain its level within a healthy benchmark range.

[should also clarify here which types of employment are measured in turnover and which are not counted.]


## Organisational Objective

The organizational objective is to keep annual turnover within the 10% to 20%. This strategic goal recognizes the importance of a dynamic yet balanced workforce – one that embraces fresh talent while sustaining established staff relationships, expertise, and institutional knowledge. By maintaining our turnover rate at this defined target, we aspire to:

1. Promote continuous learning opportunities and career development for employees within UNDP.
2. Enhance job satisfaction and employee engagement by addressing their needs and fostering a supportive work environment.
3. Establish robust recruitment strategies that attract high-quality candidates while creating an appealing organizational culture.
4. Cultivate strong employer brand reputation, enabling us to build lasting relationships with employees, job seekers, and the wider community alike.
5. Strengthen our organization's resilience by managing workforce fluctuations efficiently and minimizing disruptions due to employee departures. 

## Data

The data for Turnover is stored in the UNDP Data Warehouse. However, OHR (Office of Human Resources) has added a lot of custom business rules to this data to reach the final results, and so this dataset is pulled directly from the their PowerBI Dashboards (link?) instead. This ensures that the Performnace App always has the latest business rules automatically, instead of having to rely on manual updates to the business rules each tiem they change. 

**All the data taken is already agreegated, so there is no possibility of leaking PII (Personal Identifiable Information) or details about who has recently joined or left the organization.**

## Calculation of Scoring

Organizational objective is a turnover rate at  industry benchmark of 15%. \


Within 5% of 15%, this is green

Within 10%, this is yellow.

More than 10% is red.&#x20;

Either way.

Turnover rate 15% or lower = 100, Every percent above 15% reduces the total score by 2 pts. For example, a vacancy rate of 23% equals a score of 84.
