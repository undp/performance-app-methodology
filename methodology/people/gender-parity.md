## Introduction

## Organisational Objective

To achieve gender parity  (approximately equal number of women and men) at all organisational levels, especially at the leadership level.&#x20;

## Data

* Mention that while this data is available in the data warehouse, becuase there are lots of custom business rules applied to the raw data, this is actually pulled from the OHR PowerBI

## Calculation of Scoring

This indicator is scored according to two metrics

1. % women in the UNDP workforce overall
2. % of women in leadership makes up the other half (USG + ASG + D2 + D1 + P5 + NOE + NOD)&#x20;

For % of women in UNDPâ€™s workforce, 50% = 100; every percentage point above/below reduces the score by 1.5 pts. So, if UNDP has 45% women in the workforce, it would contribute 42.5 points to the final score.  This is only for Women, not the other way around.  \


The same method can be used for the percentage of women in leadership. So, if UNDP has 35% women in leadership, it would contribute 22.5 points to the total score (making the total score 70 in this example). If the final score has a decimal, it is rounded up. This requires the actual number of people, not the aggregate percentage because there are different numbers of people in each role. &#x20;

Each one is worth 50 points, and then sum both to get a score out of 100 points.
