# Roadmap

* **Pipeline Indicator:** Create a new indicator to measure the project pipeline. Define the methodology for calculating the pipeline indicator score. Integrate the pipeline indicator into the overall performance scoring system.
* **Evaluation Management Indicator:** Introduce an indicator to track and manage project evaluations. Establish criteria for evaluating projects based on predefined metrics. Incorporate the evaluation indicator into the performance scoring calculations.
* **Procurement Indicator:** Develop an indicator to monitor and assess procurement processes. Set up benchmarks and targets for procurement performance. Include the procurement indicator in the overall performance scoring.
* **Automated Unit Tests for Data Integrity:** Implement a comprehensive suite of automated unit tests. Ensure data integrity by validating data inputs, outputs, and transformations. Run unit tests regularly to catch and fix data inconsistencies.
* **Methodology to handle MCOs (Multi-Country Offices):** Design a methodology to represent and evaluate the performance of MCOs accurately. Consider the unique characteristics and challenges of MCOs in the scoring system. Adapt the existing indicators and calculations to accommodate MCOs.
* **Country Office Scoring:** Launch the scoring system for country offices. Based on feedback and insights, refine the scoring methodology. Introduce additional indicators or adjust weights to better reflect performance.
* **Speed Improvements:** Optimize the application's performance to reduce loading times. Implement caching mechanisms to serve frequently accessed data quickly. Streamline database queries and minimize data transfer overhead.
* **Bureau Page:** Develop a dedicated page for bureau-level performance tracking. Display aggregated performance metrics and indicators for bureaus. Allow users to drill down into specific country offices within a bureau.
* **Individual Project Pages:** Create pages for each project. Present detailed information, metrics, and performance indicators for projects. Enable users to track the progress and status of individual projects.
