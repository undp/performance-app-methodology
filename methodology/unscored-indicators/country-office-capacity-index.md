# Country Office Capacity Index

Identifying Country Offices (COs) struggling with capacity challenges allows leaders to prioritize which offices need additional support. This is particularly crucial for low-capacity offices implementing high-risk projects and portfolios. The CO Capacity Index was developed for the Performance App as part of an initiative to identify high-risk projects within the organization. It combines performance across five indicators in the app: % achievement of IRRF targets, delivery, last CO audit rating, Integrated Financial Dashboard (IFD) rating, and vacancy rate. Each CO is classified as low, medium-low, medium-high, or high capacity based on its performance in these five indicators. This index will be tested during the pilot rollout of the Performance App and adjusted over time to meet the organizationâ€™s needs.

The Capacity Index score is based on the following metrics:

1. OAI Rating
2. IFD Rating
3. Delivery Rate
4. Vacancy Rate
5. IRRF

Each metric is scored up to 20 points, which are then averaged to produce a final score out of 20, representing the official CO Capacity Index score.

**OAI Rating:**

* Fully Satisfactory = 20
* Satisfactory / Some Improvements Needed = 15
* Partially Satisfactory / Major Improvements Needed = 10
* Unsatisfactory = 0

**IFD Rating:**

* Acclaim = 20
* Satisfactory = 17
* Concern = 8
* Critical = 0

**Delivery:**

* Met or Exceeded Target = 20
* Above 95% of Target = 15
* Above 85% of Target = 10
* Below 85% of Target = 5

**Vacancy Rate (expressed as a % of total staff):**

* Below 15% Vacancy Rate = 20
* Between 15% to 20% Vacancy Rate = 17
* Between 20% to 30% Vacancy Rate = 12
* Above 30% Vacancy Rate = 8

**IRRF:**

* Met or Exceeded Target = 20
* Above 95% = 17
* Between 85% to 95% = 12
* Below 85% = 8

**Total Calculations:**

* High Capacity: 16+
* Medium-High Capacity: 13 to <16
* Medium-Low Capacity: 11 to <13
* Low Capacity: <11

The final score is normalized to 100.
