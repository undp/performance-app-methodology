## Introduction to the Indicator

## Calculation of Scoring

We do a straight trendline from 0 to 100% for contributions.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;We do a straight trendline instead of monthly trendlines based on five-year averages (the same approach as the Delivery Indicator) because do not have historical month-by-month data for Contributions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

For each 1% below the trendline, we remove 3 points from the 100 scores.

The traffic light scoring system for this indicator is:&#x20;

* Green = 85+
* Yellow =  70+
* Red = <70
