## Introduction to the Indicator

\
The Moonshots come [from the 2022â€”2025 Strategic Plan. ](https://strategicplan.undp.org/)

There are four Moonshots:

1. 100 million people to escape multidimensional poverty
2. Access to clean energy for 500 million people
3. 800 million people to participate in elections&#x20;
4. $1 trillion of public expenditure and private capital invested in the SDGs.

## Organisational Objective

\
The organisational objective is to achieve the four Moonshots, which requires staying on track throughout the four years of the strategic plan.

## Calculation of Scoring.

So, each Strategic Moonshot is worth 25 points of the overall indicator. If a Strategic Moonshot meets or exceeds the milestone, it is counted as 25 points.&#x20;

For Strategic Moonshots that have not met their milestones, we calculate the % achievement and then multiply that percentage by 25 points to get the amount of points contribution to the overall score.

So, if a particular Strategic Moonshot has met only 70% of the milestone, then 70% x 25 = 17.5

So, out of the maximum 25 points contribution to the total indicator, it will contribute 17.5 points.&#x20;

For indicators that have a range, we take the average of the range.&#x20;

The traffic light indicator methodology for this indicator is:

* Green = 85+
* Yellow = 60+
* Red = <60
