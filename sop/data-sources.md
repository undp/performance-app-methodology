# Data Sources

We four main data sources:

1. UNDP Data Warehouses
2. UNDP Data Cube
3. PowerBI
4. Manual Exports

## 1. UNDP Data Warehouse

- SESP / PQA
- ICPE
- Pipeline
- IATI (for master project lists)


## 2. UNDP Data Cube

We're pulling delivery, contributions, and institutional revenue and institutional resources. Audit data and IFD data is also pulled from here.. 


## 3. PowerBI

- OHR Datasets (Turnover, Vacancy Rate, Gender Parity, and Engagement). This is manually exported from PowerBI due to access issues. In the future, we want to be able to access the semantic model directly for daily updates 
- Workforce numbers are from OHR PowerBI
