## Introduction

The Delivery Indicator within the Performance App focuses on monitoring and evaluating the achievement of delivery targets at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This indicator is crucial for understanding how effectively UNDP meets its operational and project-related goals over time.

## Organisational Objective

To meet the delivery targets each year and to grow overall delivery year-on-year.

## Calculation of Scoring

The scoring system for the Delivery indicator at UNDP is a dynamic and sophisticated method designed to provide a detailed understanding of performance against set targets, considering historical achievements and current efforts.

The process begins with a trend analysis, where the average percentage of targets reached each month over the past five years is calculated. This historical data establishes a trendline as a benchmark for assessing current performance. The construction of this trendline is important, as it incorporates seasonal variations and long-term trends, thus setting a realistic standard for current and future performance evaluation.

Following the establishment of this trendline, the current month's performance is compared against it. This comparison is crucial as it offers immediate insights into how the current efforts align with historical standards. It measures the consistency and effectiveness of the current strategies when viewed in the context of past performance.

The final step in the scoring process is the application of a scoring metric. If the current month's performance matches or surpasses the trendline, a full score of 100% is awarded, symbolising that the performance is either consistent with or better than the average historical performance. However, if the current performance falls below the trendline, a penalty is applied: for every 1% decrease from the trendline, the score is reduced by 3 points from a total of 100. For instance, if the performance is 3% below the trendline, a deduction of 9 points (3% times 3 points) is made, resulting in a score of 91%. This scoring method is deliberate, highlighting the importance of meeting or exceeding past performances and acting as a motivational factor to strive for consistency or improvement.

The traffic light indicator methodology for this indicator is:

* Green = 85+
* Yellow = 70+
* Red = <70

## Limitations and Future Improvements

Ideally, there should be an exponential penalty for each month. Being 10% behind the average trend of the last five years in January is not a significant issue compared to being 10% behind in December when most of the year's delivery has already happened.
