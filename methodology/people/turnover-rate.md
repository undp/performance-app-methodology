## Introduction

## Organisational Objective

## Data

* Mention that while this data is available in the data warehouse, becuase there are lots of custom business rules applied to the raw data, this is actually pulled from the OHR PowerBI

## Data Export

## Calculation of Scoring

Organizational objective is a turnover rate at  industry benchmark of 15%. \


Within 5% of 15%, thsi is green

Within 10%, this is yellow.

More than 10% is red.&#x20;

Either way.

Turnover rate 15% or lower = 100, Every percent above 15% reduces the total score by 2 pts. For example, a vacancy rate of 23% equals a score of 84.
