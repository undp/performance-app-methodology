# FAQ

**What is the Performance App?**

The Performance App is a tool designed to comprehensively view UNDP's performance across key areas: impact, accountability, efficiency, values, and people.

**Why was the Performance App developed?**

The Performance App was developed to address the need for a coherent approach to performance monitoring. Previously, bureaus and country offices relied on numerous disparate dashboards, making it challenging to connect the dots, make decisions, and prioritize areas for improvement and support.

**How does the Performance App measure performance?**&#x20;

The app uses a traffic light system (green, yellow, red) and normalizes scores to a 0-100 scale, enabling quick comprehension and comparisons across diverse indicators. This allows for the aggregation of data into an intuitive overall index. What are the key focus areas of the Performance App? The app covers five key areas: impact, accountability, efficiency, values, and people. These areas provide a holistic view of organizational performance. How often is the data in the Performance App updated? The data refresh rate varies for each indicator. Some indicators are updated daily, while others are updated annually or ad hoc. The methodology document specifies the refresh rate for each indicator.&#x20;

**How can bureaus and country offices provide feedback on the Performance App?**&#x20;

The methodology will evolve based on feedback from across the organization. The process and channels for providing input, suggesting new indicators, or raising concerns will be clarified to ensure active engagement and buy-in.&#x20;

**Are there any limitations to the Performance App?**&#x20;

While the Performance App covers a wide range of performance dimensions, it's essential to acknowledge that quantitative measures may not capture all important qualitative factors. The app aims to provide opportunities to surface crucial context behind the numbers for a complete performance picture.&#x20;

**How does the Performance App handle changes in data sources or calculation methods over time?**&#x20;

The methodology acknowledges the importance of consistency but recognizes that change is inevitable. Any changes or discontinuities in data sources, calculation methods, or indicator definitions over time will be transparently communicated to build trust.&#x20;

**Can I access the Performance App from my mobile device?**&#x20;

Yes, the Performance App is designed to be accessible from various devices, including mobile phones and tablets, to ensure easy access to performance data on the go.&#x20;

**Is the Performance App's methodology document available for review?**&#x20;

Yes, the methodology document is available for review and is version-controlled on GitHub. This allows for transparency and the ability to track changes over time.&#x20;
